# Availability-Accessibility-and-Inequalities-of-WASH-Services-in-Indian-Metro-Cities

This paper focuses on the availability and accessibility of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) in six major Indian cities: Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, and Hyderabad, based on data from the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) conducted in 2004-05 and 2011-12. WASH is critical for promoting public health and ensuring basic human rights. The report highlights that while the overall WASH performance improved in 2011-12 compared to 2004-05, the change was not uniform across all cities so we like to show Inequality of availabilty, accesibility and overall wash faciities using graphs and various inequality Index like Gini Index, THEIL Index and Atkinsons Index. Factors like literacy, housing conditions, economic stability, and social status contributed to this disparity. To support sustainable metropolitan development, it is essential to prioritize the equitable distribution of WASH services. This study seeks to reproduce and extend the findings of the original report using IHDS data from both survey rounds.
